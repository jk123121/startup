Pitch:
League of Legends is a widely popular game that lets you build a team with your friends and verse others. However, there is a time limit for selecting your characters. Usually, this and the lack of organization in the game client causes chaos and the team is not built correctly. Using this app, you'll be able to pre-select your characters and coordinate with your teammate so that you can have the best strategy for versing other teams!
